# Complete Article Studio Migration Plan: AI SDK Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the complete migration strategy for Article Studio from manual OpenAI API streaming to the AI SDK framework. The current implementation suffers from React Error #31 and streaming reliability issues due to complex manual handling of OpenAI's Server-Sent Events (SSE) in the Deno edge function.

## Current Issues

### Technical Problems
- **React Error #31**: Caused by improper type handling and Promise rendering in React components
- **Streaming Failures**: Manual SSE parsing results in 0 chunks being processed
- **Type Safety Issues**: `streamingStatus` typed as `any` instead of `string`
- **Complex Error Handling**: Manual stream management leads to frequent failures
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Custom streaming implementation is difficult to debug and maintain

### Root Cause Analysis
The fundamental issue is the manual handling of OpenAI's streaming response in `supabase/functions/generate-content/index.ts`. The current approach:
1. Manually parses Server-Sent Events from OpenAI
2. Creates custom ReadableStream with complex error handling
3. Relies on frontend parsing of custom stream format
4. Lacks proper type safety and error recovery

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Setup AI SDK Infrastructure

#### 1.1 Install AI SDK Dependencies
```bash
npm install ai @ai-sdk/react @ai-sdk/openai
```

Required packages:
- `ai`: Core AI SDK functionality
- `@ai-sdk/react`: React hooks for streaming UI
- `@ai-sdk/openai`: OpenAI provider integration

#### 1.2 Create API Route Structure
Create a Next.js-style API route adapted for the current React Router setup:
- `src/api/chat/route.ts`: Main streaming endpoint
- Integrate with existing Supabase credit system
- Maintain authentication and security

### Phase 2: Backend Implementation

#### 2.1 New Route Handler (`src/api/chat/route.ts`)
```typescript
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { streamText } from 'ai';
import { supabase } from '@/integrations/supabase/client';

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  // Credit deduction and authentication
  const { title, outline, keywords, audience, tone } = await req.json();
  
  // Use AI SDK streamText instead of manual OpenAI calls
  const result = streamText({
    model: openai('gpt-4o-mini'),
    messages: [
      { role: 'system', content: 'You are an expert content writer...' },
      { role: 'user', content: generatePrompt(title, outline, keywords, audience, tone) }
    ],
    temperature: 0.7,
    maxTokens: 4000,
  });

  return result.toDataStreamResponse();
}
```

#### 2.2 Credit System Integration
- Maintain existing `deduct_credits` function call
- Integrate with Supabase authentication
- Preserve error handling for insufficient credits

### Phase 3: Frontend Migration

#### 3.1 Replace Manual Streaming with useChat Hook

**Current Implementation** (UnifiedControlPanel.tsx):
```typescript
// Complex manual fetch and stream parsing
const response = await fetch(fetchUrl, { ... });
const reader = response.body?.getReader();
// Manual chunk processing...
```

**New Implementation**:
```typescript
import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';

const { messages, input, handleSubmit, isLoading, error } = useChat({
  api: '/api/chat',
  maxSteps: 5,
  onError: (error) => {
    console.error('Streaming error:', error);
  }
});
```

#### 3.2 Update Component Architecture

**StreamingArticlePreview.tsx Updates**:
- Use AI SDK message format instead of custom streaming
- Leverage built-in streaming components from AI SDK
- Simplify real-time content display

**LivePreviewPanel.tsx Updates**:
- Remove manual stream status management
- Use AI SDK error handling patterns
- Integrate with new message-based architecture

#### 3.3 Type Safety Improvements
- Replace `streamingStatus?: any` with proper AI SDK types
- Use AI SDK's built-in message and error types
- Eliminate manual type guards and string validation

### Phase 4: Integration Points

#### 4.1 Supabase Integration
- Maintain existing authentication flow
- Preserve credit deduction system
- Keep article saving functionality intact

#### 4.2 SEO and Content Features
- Preserve keyword integration
- Maintain audience targeting
- Keep outline-based content generation
- Retain tone and writing style options

#### 4.3 UI/UX Consistency
- Maintain existing visual design
- Preserve real-time preview functionality
- Keep progress indicators and status updates

### Phase 5: Testing Strategy

#### 5.1 Feature Parity Testing
- [ ] Title and outline input works correctly
- [ ] Keywords and audience settings are preserved
- [ ] Real-time streaming displays content
- [ ] Credit deduction functions properly
- [ ] Error handling works as expected
- [ ] Article saving and navigation works

#### 5.2 Performance Testing
- [ ] Streaming latency is acceptable
- [ ] Memory usage is optimized
- [ ] Error recovery is robust
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness maintained

#### 5.3 Integration Testing
- [ ] Supabase authentication works
- [ ] Credit system integration functions
- [ ] Article Studio workflow is complete
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility verified

### Phase 6: Deployment and Cleanup

#### 6.1 Gradual Migration
1. Implement AI SDK alongside existing system
2. Add feature flag to switch between implementations
3. Test thoroughly in staging environment
4. Gradually roll out to users
5. Monitor for issues and performance

#### 6.2 Legacy Code Cleanup
- [ ] Remove `supabase/functions/generate-content/index.ts`
- [ ] Clean up manual streaming logic in components
- [ ] Update type definitions
- [ ] Remove unused dependencies
- [ ] Update documentation
