### Phase 3: AI SDK Migration (CRITICAL FIX - NEXT PRIORITY)

#### 3.1 Root Cause Analysis
**Current Issues**:
- [ ] React Error #31: Objects rendered as React children due to type safety violations
- [ ] Streaming failures: Manual SSE parsing in `generate-content/index.ts` fails silently
- [ ] Type issues: `streamingStatus` typed as `any` instead of `string`
- [ ] Complex error handling leading to stream termination

#### 3.2 AI SDK Implementation Plan
**Step 1**: Create new API route structure
```typescript
// src/api/chat/route.ts
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { streamText } from 'ai';

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { title, outline, keywords, audience, tone } = await req.json();
  
  const result = streamText({
    model: openai('gpt-4o-mini'),
    messages: [
      { role: 'system', content: 'You are an expert content writer...' },
      { role: 'user', content: generatePrompt(title, outline, keywords, audience, tone) }
    ],
    temperature: 0.7,
    maxTokens: 4000,
  });

  return result.toDataStreamResponse();
}
```

**Step 2**: Replace frontend manual streaming
```typescript
import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';

const { messages, input, handleSubmit, isLoading, error } = useChat({
  api: '/api/chat',
  maxSteps: 5,
  onError: (error) => console.error('Streaming error:', error)
});
```

#### 3.3 Type Safety Improvements
**Files to Update**:
- [ ] `StreamingArticlePreview.tsx`: Replace `streamingStatus?: any` with proper AI SDK types
- [ ] `LivePreviewPanel.tsx`: Remove manual type guards and string validation
- [ ] `useArticleStudio.ts`: Use AI SDK's built-in message and error types

### Phase 4: Enhanced Content Generation

#### 4.1 Two-Phase Generation Flow
- [ ] **Phase 1: Skeleton Generation** - Basic content structure without web search
- [ ] **Phase 2: Web Enhancement** - Research each section with OpenAI/Tavily integration

#### 4.2 Progress Status Implementation
```typescript
const progressMessages = [
  "Generating article outline...",
  "Writing introduction...",
  "Researching latest trends for '{section}'...",
  "Enhancing section with industry insights...",
  "Finalizing content..."
];
```

#### 4.3 Novel Editor Integration
- [ ] Transaction-based updates for conflict-free insertion
- [ ] Progress indicators within editor content
- [ ] Preserve all existing Novel AI features (slash commands, bubble menu)

### Phase 5: Advanced Features Implementation

#### 5.1 Loading Screen Implementation
**New Components to Create**:
- [ ] `LoadingOverlay.tsx` - Between step transitions
- [ ] `StepTransitionLoader.tsx` - Progress indicators
- [ ] `GenerationProgress.tsx` - Article generation status

#### 5.2 Enhanced Outline Creation
- [ ] `OutlineEditor.tsx` - Drag-and-drop outline management
- [ ] Hierarchical display with character count estimates
- [ ] Add/remove/reorder sections with visual feedback
