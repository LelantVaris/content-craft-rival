## Issue: Timeout Error During Article Generation

### Problem Description
The enhanced article generation feature is experiencing timeout issues where the process is aborted after 30 seconds, resulting in an `AbortError: BodyStreamBuffer was aborted`.

### Root Cause Analysis
- **Client-side timeout**: 30-second timeout is too short for comprehensive article generation
- **Generation time**: Complex articles with 4000+ words and detailed PVOD framework implementation require 60-90 seconds
- **Streaming issues**: Long OpenAI API calls without intermediate progress updates cause connection timeouts

### Console Log Evidence
```
üì§ Making PVOD content request...
üì• Response received: Status: 200, OK: true
üîÑ Starting to read stream...
‚ùå Request was aborted (timeout)
Error: AbortError: BodyStreamBuffer was aborted
```

### Debug Status
‚úÖ Parameters are correctly validated and passed to the edge function
‚úÖ Supabase session and authentication working properly  
‚úÖ Edge function receives request successfully (200 OK response)
‚úÖ Stream reading starts correctly
‚ùå Process times out after 30 seconds during content generation

## Comprehensive Fix Plan

### Phase 1: Increase Client-Side Timeout ‚≠ê URGENT
- **Current**: 30-second timeout
- **Target**: 120 seconds (2 minutes)
- **File**: `src/hooks/useEnhancedContentGeneration.ts`
- **Change**: Update AbortController timeout from 30000ms to 120000ms

### Phase 2: Add Streaming Progress Indicators
- **Problem**: No intermediate feedback during long generation
- **Solution**: Edge function sends progress updates every 10-15 seconds
- **File**: `supabase/functions/generate-enhanced-content/index.ts`
- **Implementation**: Add keep-alive progress events during OpenAI streaming

### Phase 3: Optimize Edge Function Performance
- **Current**: Single large OpenAI call
- **Optimization**: Progressive streaming and better error handling
- **Features**:
  - Connection keep-alive mechanisms
  - Partial content recovery
  - Fallback for incomplete generations

### Phase 4: Improve User Experience
- **Status messages**: "This may take up to 2 minutes..."
- **Progress indicators**: Show estimated time remaining
- **Phase display**: Show current generation step

## Implementation Priority
1. **Immediate**: Fix timeout (Phase 1) - 5 minutes
2. **Short-term**: Add progress indicators (Phase 2) - 15 minutes  
3. **Medium-term**: Optimize performance (Phase 3) - 30 minutes
4. **Enhancement**: Improve UX (Phase 4) - 15 minutes

## Expected Results
- ‚úÖ Articles generate successfully without timing out
- ‚úÖ Users see progress during 60-90 second generation
- ‚úÖ Better error handling and recovery
- ‚úÖ Improved user feedback and experience

## Test Cases
- [ ] Generate 4000-word article with complex outline
- [ ] Verify progress updates appear every 10-15 seconds
- [ ] Test timeout handling with 2-minute limit
- [ ] Confirm partial content recovery on interruption
